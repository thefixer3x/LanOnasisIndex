For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

Use stock photos from unsplash where appropriate, only valid URLs you know exist. Do not download the images, only link to them in image tags.

Draft Landing Page Concept

1. Hero Section
	•	Background:
A full‑width, dark, high‑contrast background with subtle animated silhouettes (inspired by bolt.new/Revolut). A gradient overlay (e.g., deep navy to charcoal black) gives depth. Optionally, include a light/dark toggle in the header.
	•	Headline:
“Reinventing the Future through VortexCore AI and Beyond.”
	•	Subheadline:
“Building Africa’s most intelligent tech ecosystem with secure, compliant, and AI-enhanced platforms that empower entrepreneurs, regulators, fintechs, and institutions alike.”
	•	Call-to‑Action (CTA):
A prominent button with a contrasting accent color (such as neon blue or vibrant green) labeled “Explore Our Ecosystem” that smoothly scrolls down to the ecosystem section.

2. Navigation Bar
	•	Items:
	•	Home
	•	Our Vision
	•	The Ecosystem
	•	Our Story
	•	Contact
	•	Style:
Minimal, transparent background (which becomes solid on scroll), using clean sans‑serif typography. Include the Lan Onasis logo at the top left.

3. Our Vision Section
	•	Layout:
Two‑column layout on desktop (stacked on mobile).
	•	Left Column: A compelling short video or animated illustration showing digital innovation and transformation (think “futuristic tech meets African ingenuity”).
	•	Right Column:
	•	A headline: “Our Vision.”
	•	A bulleted list:
	•	To build Africa’s most intelligent tech ecosystem.
	•	Expanding globally with secure, compliant, AI‑enhanced platforms.
	•	Empowering businesses, fintechs, and regulators to innovate without borders.
	•	A brief paragraph emphasizing that this is more than a pivot—it’s a redefinition of modern business systems.

4. The Vortex Ecosystem Section
	•	Presentation:
Use a card‑oriented layout (responsive grid) to showcase each core service. Each card features:
	•	Icon or minimal illustration (consistent with the dark theme).
	•	Service Name & Tagline:
	•	VortexCore AI – Your intelligent assistant for compliance and business solutions
	•	VortexComply – Compliance-as-a-Service, KYC/KYB, AML
	•	VortexRisk (RiskGPT) – AI‑driven risk monitoring and analysis
	•	VortexShield – Security infrastructure for cross‑border safety
	•	VortexIQ – Business intelligence engine
	•	VortexPay – Instant vendor disbursements and B2B payments
	•	BizGenie – Embedded AI for SME insights and cash flow guidance
	•	Interactive Hover Effects: Cards reveal a short description when hovered.

5. Our Story / Origin Section
	•	Content:
A narrative block that tells the “Built by Visionaries” origin story:
	•	“What began as a pursuit of excellence in consulting and business development evolved into a revolutionary movement. A group of passionate minds set out not just to consult, but to build the tools, platforms, and ecosystems that make life easier, businesses smarter, and borders irrelevant. From that vision, Lan Onasis was born—fueling the VortexCore revolution and shaping how the world moves, pays, verifies, protects, and grows.”
	•	Visuals:
A timeline or parallax scroll effect that interweaves key moments in your brand evolution (using subtle animations that work well on a dark background).

6. Social & Hashtag Strategy
	•	Display:
A banner or footer section that lightly showcases your key hashtags (e.g., #LanOnasis, #VortexCoreAI, #RiskGPT, #VortexPay) in a creative typographic style, reinforcing the social identity of your brand.

7. Footer
	•	Content:
	•	Quick links (Home, Vision, Ecosystem, Story, Contact).
	•	Social media icons (integrated in the dark theme style).
	•	A brief copyright notice and any legal links.
	•	Optionally, a newsletter signup form.
	•	Style:
Keep the footer simple and minimal with a dark background that matches the rest of the page, with legible, light‑colored text.

1. Hero Section
	•	Background & Aesthetics:
A full‑width, dark-themed hero with an optional light mode toggle. The background is a deep gradient (e.g., midnight blue to charcoal black) with subtle, animated silhouettes—evocative of bolt.new/Revolut. Small particles or “light streaks” can animate gently to give a futuristic vibe.
	•	Content:
	•	Headline: “Reinventing the Future through VortexCore AI and Beyond.”
	•	Subheadline: “Building Africa’s most intelligent tech ecosystem—empowering entrepreneurs, fintechs, and institutions with secure, compliant, AI‑enhanced platforms.”
	•	CTA Button: A high‑contrast button (using an accent like neon blue or vibrant green) labeled “Explore Our Ecosystem” that scrolls down.
	•	Navigation Bar:
Transparent on top that becomes solid on scroll. Includes links: Home, Our Vision, The Ecosystem, Our Story, Contact. The Lan Onasis logo sits on the left.

	•	A bullet list:
	•	To build Africa’s most intelligent tech ecosystem.
